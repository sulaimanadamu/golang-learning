guessing-number-game.go : is my first golang program after leaning control flow in golang
i decide to create something fun so i create this small program which is a replica of a 
nigeria game, where one think of a number in his mind then another person have to guess the number
it was a fun childhood game. now a computer will guess a number then we will try to predict it.
